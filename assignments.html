<h2 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h2>
<p>Make sure you are familiar with the lateness policy, as well as the other assignment policies set out in the course <a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc343h/winter/syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-submission">Assignment submission</h2>
<p>All assignments will be submitted electronically, using <a href="https://markus.cdf.toronto.edu/csc343-2015-01">MarkUs</a>. Log in using your CDF login and password. When working in a pair, which is allowed for assignments but <strong>not lecture prep exercises</strong>, only one person should submit the assignment.</p>
<h3 id="declaring-a-partnership">Declaring a partnership</h3>
<p>You are encouraged to work in a pair for your assignments. Prior to submitting your work, you must declare on MarkUs whether you are working alone or with a partner. <strong>You must make this declaration before the due date,</strong> even if you will be using grace points to submit late.</p>
<p>To declare your partnership, one of you needs to invite the other to be a partner, and then the invited person needs to accept the invitation. To invite a partner, navigate to the appropriate MarkUs page for that assignment, find "Group Information", and click on "Invite". You will be prompted for the other student's CDF user name; enter it. To accept an invitation, find "Group Information" on the appropriate Assignment page, find the invitation listed there, and click on "Join".</p>
<p>Although only one partner should submit the assignment, because you declared your partnership, we will know that both of you should get credit for the work -- no matter which of you submits it.</p>
<h3 id="submitting-your-work-tip-use-chrome-or-firefox">Submitting your work (tip: use Chrome or Firefox)</h3>
<p>To submit your work, navigate to the MarkUs page for the particular exercise or assignment, then click on the "Submissions" tab near the top. Click "Add a New File" and either type a file name or use the "Browse" button to choose one. Then click "Submit". You can submit a new version of a file later (before the deadline, of course); look in the "Replace" column.</p>
<p>Once you have submitted, click on the file's name to check that you submitted the correct version; remember that spelling of filenames, including case, counts. <strong>If your file is not named correctly, your code will receive zero for correctness.</strong></p>
<h2 id="working-successfully-in-a-pair">Working successfully in a pair</h2>
<p>If you are working with a partner, make sure that you are actually working together. Your goal should be for the two of you to help each other learn the material and to avoid getting stuck with frustrating errors. If you split up the assignment and work separately, you are not getting practice on all aspects of the assignment.</p>
<p>Sometimes a student who is working with a partner drops the course in the middle of an assignment. If this happens, the other partner is still responsible for completing the assignment on time. If he or she has been actively engaged in the entire assignment, this should not be a problem; the assignments are designed so that an individual student can complete them. However, if the remaining partner has not been actively involved or does not have copies of all of the work, they will have serious difficulty completing the assignment. Make sure you don't find yourself in this situation: Be active in all parts of the assignment, and make sure that at the end of each meeting, both partners have a copy of all of the work.</p>
