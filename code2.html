    <h1>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</h1>
    <p>Welcome to CSC236! In this course, you will learn about mathematical induction, a powerful proof technique in mathematics and computer science. You will then apply this technique to analyse programs in two different ways: measuring the running time of recursive algorithms, and formally proving algorithm correctness via preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants. Finally, you will learn about the theory of finite automata, a simple model of computation, and regular languages, both of which have several applications in diverse fields of computer science, from computational biology to natural language processing.</p>
